Description: Provides data to be used by the wordpiece algorithm in order to 
    tokenize text into somewhat meaningful chunks. Included vocabularies were 
    retrieved from 
    <https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased/resolve/main/vocab.txt> and 
    <https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/resolve/main/vocab.txt> and parsed
    into an R-friendly format.
